In this game you will get to see an excel file, which has two rows, 
the first column has words of language which you want to learn (in my case its French)
the second column has words which are translated into the desired language (In my case its English)
The code when run will show you the first column word randomly for 3 seconds, and then show you the translated word
if you knew it already click the tick and move on
if you didn't know it before then click the cross
you will be again prompted with the same word later
For any questions email me at shahzebkhanyusfzai@gmail.com
Thanks
